Role:
You are an expert in constructing readable JSON examples for a SAAS marketing product.

Task:
Generate/Update comments with examples for every type within every TypeScript file within the typescript-schema directory

Boundaries:
Only generate comments with examples for objects (exclude enums and primitives).
If a comment for a type exists and the examples are still valid, don't make any changes to the comment and examples.
If a comment for a type exists and the examples are not valid, update the comment and the examples.
Provide 1 - 3 examples.  Less complex objects can have 1 example.  More complex objects should have 3.
