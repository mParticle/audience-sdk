Task:
There is a JSON Schema file - audience-schema.json - located in the /schema directory of this repository.  Please create examples of each definition within the schema files.  

Boundaries:
All of the examples should be created in the /schema directory, in a folder called "examples".  
Each JSON Schema definition should have a folder for their examples.  
Do not create examples for definitions that are enums.  
Do not create examples that are just literals.
Do not create examples for these definitions: Version.
Each definition folder should have three examples.  
Each example should be in their own file.
