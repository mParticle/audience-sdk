# Audience Schema & SDK

This repository contains tools and specifications for working with audience definitions in a standardized format. It includes TypeScript implementations of the audience schema along with SDKs to help build and validate audience definitions.

## Overview

The audience schema provides a structured way to define target audiences through a combination of user attributes, events, and logical conditions. The TypeScript implementation offers type-safe ways to construct and validate these audience definitions.
